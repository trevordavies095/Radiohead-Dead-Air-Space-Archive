ItÃ¢&#8364; s in the small town of Kuruman 2 Ãƒ‚Ãƒ‚½ hoursÃ¢&#8364;  drive from the mining centre of Kimberley. Sam, Lesedi, myself and Lebo flew into Kimberley early Wednesday morning and drove to Kuruman. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebo is&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the youth trainers at Kurara FM, living in a<span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\">&nbsp;small settlement just outside Kurman. &nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The station plays a wide selection of music throughout the day Ã¢&#8364;\" Afropop in the morning, R&amp;B at lunchtime as well as hip hop and house for stepping out at night. The music is great, especially the Afropop Ã¢&#8364;\" I hadnÃ¢&#8364; t heard much before and I love the wild synth riffing over drum machine grooves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lebo and her team of young reporters broadcast their programme, 'Cracking It', from 10.00 to 10.30 am every weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>'Cracking It' talks about family life, sex education (or Ã¢&#8364;~life orientation' as it's known out here) and the problems and issues facing kids and young people in their communities. Violence in the family, bullying at school and teenage pregnancies are just some of the topics discussed by the children in their radio reports and interviews. &nbsp;</p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76388806\"></iframe>&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.45em;\"><br></span></p><p><p>I met some of the young reporters later in the afternoon, after school, and after another flawless inquisition on their part, I cocked up when it was my turn to interview them and forgot to press record for most of the interview - Doh!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can listen to some of my interviews with the young people on the projects below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At tea-time we were invited back by one of the young reporters, Tlotlego Maroro, to meet his family and see where he lives, in a village just outside town. We met his mum and showed her TlotlegoÃ¢&#8364; s film.</p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/57479499\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p><p></p>\r\n",
