Due to Sunday night's torrential rain storm and consequential multiple road closures, many fans were unable to reach the Nissan Pavilion. While acknowledging a lack of control over the ensuing flooding and detours, the members of Radiohead are nevertheless disappointed regarding this turn of events. For further inquiries, ticketholders who didn't get in are urged to contact: <a class="bol" href="http://mailto: customerservice@nissanpavilion.com" target="_blank">customerservice@nissanpavilion.com</a>
