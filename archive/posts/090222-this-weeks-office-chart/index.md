Tried to do a <a class="bol" href="http://open.spotify.com/user/mrmarmite/playlist/63te3X294nmljhdTq31eyE" target="_blank">Spotify</a> arab collection.....but no Laila Mourad, or Um Khalthum, or much Abdel Halim Hefez on spotify yet......so it's bolstered with some random classical stuff - but then, it's all orchestras sitting down, right?<br/><br/>Talking of which - found out this week about the old Baghdad music school for blind children - hence the shaded musicians in arab orchestras, the prevalence of which I could never understand. I (offensively?) assumed it was just 60's iraqi hipsters being 60's iraqi hipsters...though they were that too, of course....<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
