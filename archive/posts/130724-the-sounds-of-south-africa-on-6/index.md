<p><br/></p><p>A few months ago I was lucky enough to be approached by one of my favourite radio stations to make a series of programmes.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday 28th July between 4pm and 6pm I'll be presenting the Sounds of South Africa on BBC 6 Music. It's a programme all about South African music with a bit of politics thrown in.&nbsp;</p><p>As Global Ambassador of the Children's Radio Foundation I've recently travelled round South Africa a bit and I've heard a load of fantastic music. I'll be playing some of my favourites in between some clips as produced by the Children's Radio Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also an interview with Jeremy Vine about his time in South Africa as the BBC correspondent. It was fun to be on the other side of the microphone, asking the questions for a change. &nbsp;</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">Have a look at&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.childrensradiofoundation.org/" style="line-height: 1.45em;">www.childrensradiofoundation.org</a><span style="line-height: 1.45em;">&nbsp;if you haven't already.</span></p>
