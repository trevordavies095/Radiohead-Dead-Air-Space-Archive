back tomorrow, after a full on week of recording a song a day, some not even on the blackboard....one of jonny's tunes, packing a lot in 2 mins 45 seconds!  Spent weekend agreeing with Nick Cohen, hoping Simon Starling would win the  Turner, listening to new modeselektor album, and waiting to get the boards of canada and pharrell williams tomorrow.  Exciting talk of shows next year;  it's good to have a plot.  Another week ahead in the studio, then more in December.  I'll keep you posted this week with more news and wonky shots, so wish us  luck!
