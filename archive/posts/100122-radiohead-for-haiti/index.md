We're doing a show this Sunday (24th January) to raise funds for the relief effort in Haiti. The venue is The Music Box Theatre at The Fonda in Los Angeles, doors at 7pm. All proceeds are going to the Oxfam Haiti relief fund. We're trying to raise as much money as possible, so tickets will be sold by auction at this site from 8pm tonight until 11am Saturday (PST):<br/><br/><a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/09004434FC1C86AC">http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/09004434FC1C86AC</a><br/><br/>We're in the middle of recording at the moment, so you'll be catching us on the fly.... but if you're up for it, then we are too.<br/><br/>See you then <br/>x<br/><br/>
