Hello Everyone,<br/><br/>The download area that is "In Rainbows" will be shutting its doors on the 10th December 2007.<br/><br/>A big thank you to everyone who came and downloaded the music. It's been the most positive thing we've done and we hope you shared the experience with others.<br/><br/>The discbox will still be available from the <a href="http://www.waste.uk.com/Store/waste-radiohead-dii-11-10023-discbox+audio.html" target="_blank">w.a.s.t.e store here</a> until they have all gone. We then have no plans to make further stock.<br/><br/>For those of you who wish to buy In Rainbows in the usual way, it will be available on CD/Vinyl and download from traditional outlets from the 31st December 2007.<br/><br/>The record will be released by TBD Records in North America and XL Recordings for the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Thanks for everything.
