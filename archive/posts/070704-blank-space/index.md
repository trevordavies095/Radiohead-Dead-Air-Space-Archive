things are quiet here right now. <br/><br/>we are unable to explain.<br/><br/>nothing can be revealed. <br/><br/>we have not disappeared. <br/><br/>merely become invisible.<br/><br/>for  a short time. we may be hiding in the woods.<br/><br/>meanwhile <a class="bol" href="http://www.thebigask.com" target="_blank">thebigask</a> has set up an online video march <br/>to hastle the government to commit to cutting our CO2. <br/>which is a good idea i think. and you can post your own message. <br/>so i'll have to do that. once i've found me camera.<br/><br/>ever since Gordon Brown became PM they have gone a little quiet on this subject. <br/>i do hope rumours of Mr Brown lack of interest in climate change aren't true. <br/>we have don't have time such crap.<br/><br/><br/>
