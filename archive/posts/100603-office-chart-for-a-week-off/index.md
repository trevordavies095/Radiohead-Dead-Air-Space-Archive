For all the nerds who are marveling, like me, at Red Dead Redemption: here's a different kind of office chart.....<br/><br/>Braid (various)<br/>Marathon (Mac)<br/>Goldeneye (N64)<br/>Elite (BBC Micro)<br/>Cave Story (various)<br/>Ico (PS2)<br/>Red  Dead Redemption (PS3)<br/>Zelda Ocarina of Time (N64)<br/>Zelda Twighlight Princess (Wii)<br/>Half Life 1 and 2 (Mac, PS3)<br/><br/>Having written that, I think Ico might be the best one. Now back to Bonnie's ranch....
