  "body": "Some ticket holders for this week's New York shows have chosen to re-sell one or both of their allocation on auction sites. Using a 2 ticket limit and will-call only access with ID, we have tried to ensure that more tickets go to the people who prefer to see the show than to cheat fellow fans with re-selling tickets at exorbitant prices.  <br><br>For those of you who have to pay over the face value of the ticket, PLEASE make sure that you are certain you can get into the show before parting with your money. A ticket is only valid with its matching credit card details and the ID of the purchaser, after which the ticket holder will be escorted straight through. <br><br>On a lighter note, we played on The Colbert Report last night. It was funny.<br>Hope this link works where you are: <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.colbertnation.com/\">http://www.colbertnation.com/</a>",
