<a href="http://www.million-against-nuclear.net/">http://www.million-against-nuclear.net/</a><br/><br/><br/>nuclear power is not going to solve our problems now anymore than it has in the past.<br/>it is only able to exist with heavy public subsidy, and a monumental turning a blind eye to the consequences by both our governments and us.<br/>this is the nuclear industrys last ditch attempt to save itself from extinction.<br/>much as the GM companies claim that they can save world hunger with modified foods the nuclear lobby claims to be able to solve our energy needs.<br/>but its bullshit.<br/><br/>thats just what i think anyway.
