<a href="videotape.html" onclick="return popUpWindow('videotape.html',25,25,499,401);" style="margin-top:0px"><img alt="" border="0" height="278" src="images/vtpiece.jpg" style="margin-top:0px" width="350"/></a><br/><br/><br/>had a niggling feeling that this never really got seen much. <br/>Its a kind of video thing to go with Videotape using lots of wierd techniques we were messing with. <br/>Nigel and I really enjoyed making it at the end of last year. <br/>It appeared at the end of a webcast which i think was lost due to transmission problems. <br/>So here it is (roughly) for you to see again.<br/>x
