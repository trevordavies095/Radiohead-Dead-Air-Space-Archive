<p>Hello and welcome,&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the start of my 11 day trip in South Africa. I'll be visiting Cape Town, Kayelitsha, Manenberg, Kuruman, Taung, Limpopo and Johannesburg.</p>
<p>I'll be meeting with young reporters, sitting in on training sessions, and sharing stories from the Children&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s Radio Foundation. I&Atilde;&cent;&euro; m very excited to be going, and I hope you&Atilde;&cent;&euro; ll enjoy some of the accounts and images I&Atilde;&cent;&euro; ll be posting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the links below to find out more - settle in and enjoy the sounds, sights and music brought to you by the CRF. &nbsp;</p>
