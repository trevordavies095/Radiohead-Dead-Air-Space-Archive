there is the best collection of outsider art in the world here<br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://www.artbrut.ch/index.cfm?Show=Oeuvres">http://www.artbrut.ch/index.cfm?Show=Oeuvres</a><br/><br/><br/>when i was at art college this collection was a big influence on me. now finally i have seen it.<br/>and it surpassed even my expectations.<br/>i found myself close to tears. and that never happens in galleries.. normally i am falling asleep<br/>or try to find a cup of coffee.<br/><br/>honestly try it.. if you are ever here, it will change you.<br/><br/>
