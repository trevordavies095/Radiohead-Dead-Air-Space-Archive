  "body": "Mark Thompson, Herr Director General of the BBC, announced yesterday that 6 music was to be closed ... which is obviously a ludicrous decision for those who actually love hearing great music on the radio ... so I've written to the BBC Trust, who apparently have the ability to reverse the decision, and if you feel this way inclined the link is        <a href=\"https://consultations.external.bbc.co.uk/departments/bbc/bbc-strategy-review/consultation/consult_view\">https://consultations.external.bbc.co.uk/departments/bbc/bbc-strategy-review/consultation/consult_view</a> <br>Here's what I wrote:<br><br><br><br><br>To whom it may concern,<br><br>I am writing regarding the news today that 6 Music is going to be closed, in the hope that you reconsider this decision.  To be honest I, along with a vast number of other musicians, music industry types and real music fans, are completely shocked and baffled by this news. I wonder if those who made this decision are actually aware of the hugely important role that 6 music plays in fostering and promoting new bands, as well as still playing the likes of the band that I am in. It literally is the radio lifeblood for music outside of the mainstream. Not to denigrate Radio's 1 and 2, but it really is the only station that puts music first, and that's from a punters point of view and not some bloke in a band. Nowhere else can you hear an archived session track from T Rex juxtaposed next to Midlake's latest release. As David Bowie, put it ... it keeps the spirit of John Peel alive.<br><br>Please realise the impact and severity of closing this station down. It will be a huge blow for new bands and their labels. It's not enough to 'refocus' Radio's 1 and 2 as 6 music does a very specific thing. What you have with 6 Music is a gem of a radio station, it is doing what no other station in the world does or can possibly do. Remember it is also still relatively young, give it time. You also finally have a fantastic and seemingly settled line up of DJ's. Please get behind it and from what I can gather about its annual budget of Ãƒ‚£6m, it surely punches way above its weight in terms of cultural relevance and importance.<br><br>Thank you for considering this.<br><br>Ed O'Brien (Radiohead)",
