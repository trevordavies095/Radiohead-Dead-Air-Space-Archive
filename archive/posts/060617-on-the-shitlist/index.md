this'll make you laugh.<br/><br/>i was told yesterday that one of the daughters of the president came to NY show 2.<br/>we were playing THe Tourist at the end of the show.. and yyes we did wander what the shuffling manhandling fighting was in the distance of the audience.<br/>turns out it was her 6 bodyguards clearing the way for the first daughters exit. and some pour soul objected at being manhandled by the secret service. i think i would have to.<br/><br/>infact if i had known all this my objections would have been more forthright and extensive...if you know what i mean. which is perhaps why our lot chose not to tell me who was in the building  before we went on. probably a good idea.<br/><br/><br/>hmm<br/>i dont know if we should be<br/><br/>A. honoured<br/>B. amused<br/>C. bemused<br/>D. ask if she had a valid ticket<br/>E. object belatedly on moral grounds<br/>F. ask again if she had a ticket and question whether this really what our gigs are about<br/>G. dont blame the daughter for the father <br/>H. shutup and smile<br/><br/>answers on a postcard<br/><br/>bonaroo today woo hoo<br/>
