Rough Trade and the band apologise for any inconvenience caused.<br><br>Allocated wristbands only remain valid for the new venue. Doors open at 9pm prompt. There will be no admittance to anyone without a wristband and there will be no screens or speakers outside the venue - however the show will still be webcast from <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.radiohead.tv\">www.radiohead.tv</a>!",
