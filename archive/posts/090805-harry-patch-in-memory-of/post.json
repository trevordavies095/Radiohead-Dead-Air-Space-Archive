The strings were arranged by Jonny.<br>I very much hope the song does justice to his memory as the last survivor.<br><br>It would be very easy for our generation to forget the true horror of war, without the likes of Harry to remind us.<br>I hope we do not forget.<br><br>As Harry himself said<br>\"Irrespective of the uniforms we wore, we were all victims\".<br><br>This morning the Today program played the song for the first time and now it is available to <a href=\"http://download.waste.uk.com\" target=\"_blank\">download from our website</a>.<br>\n<br>The proceeds of this song will go to the British Legion.<br><br>To peace and understanding.",
