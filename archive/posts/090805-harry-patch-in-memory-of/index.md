<b>"i am the only one that got through<br/>the others died  where ever  they fell<br/>it was an  ambush  <br/>they came up from all  sides  <br/>give your leaders each a gun and then let them  fight it out  themselves<br/>i've seen devils coming up  from the  ground<br/>i've seen hell upon this  earth<br/>the  next will be chemical but they will never  learn"  </b><br/><br/>Recently the last remaining UK veteran of the 1st world war Harry Patch died at the age of 111.<br/>I had heard a very emotional interview with him a few years ago on the Today program on Radio4.<br/>The way he talked about war had a profound effect on me.<br/>It became the inspiration for a song that we happened to record a few weeks before his death.<br/>It was done live in an abbey. The strings were arranged by Jonny.<br/>I very much hope the song does justice to his memory as the last survivor.<br/><br/>It would be very easy for our generation to forget the true horror of war, without the likes of Harry to remind us.<br/>I hope we do not forget.<br/><br/>As Harry himself said<br/>"Irrespective of the uniforms we wore, we were all victims".<br/><br/>This morning the Today program played the song for the first time and now it is available to <a href="http://download.waste.uk.com" target="_blank">download from our website</a>.<br/>
<br/>The proceeds of this song will go to the British Legion.<br/><br/>To peace and understanding.
