Some debating will be done in Copenhagen by those who, whether they admit it or not, hope not to to see the full consequences.<br/>The youth are the ones who will inherit what happens now.<br/>Below is a site where a 1000 kids from 100 different countries are debating the issues.<br/>Some fresh minds with fresh ideas and no baggage would be nice no?<br/><br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://gyp.debatewise.org" target="_blank">DEBATEWISE.ORG</a>
