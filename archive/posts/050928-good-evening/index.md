right now colin is reading that strange devarahi synth book.<br/><br/>stanley is hammering and making greetings cards which may or may not be for christmas.<br/><br/>im working on something that i think is called PAY DAY. im gonna lay the lyrics line by line on the floor and shuffle them. and im having to play gentle fingerpicking over furious beat.<br/><br/>ed is  sick as a dog at the moment poor guy. he is feeling very sorry for himself and keeps sending us sad little texts.<br/><br/>in the distance there is a cloud but as im in an ok mood i can keep it away<br/>........friends of the earth have asked me whether i would meet Tony Blair at downing street to discuss what our government is not doing about climate change..i dont know if this will ever happen for certain.... it is rattling around in the back of my mind and concerns me a lot. <br/>i have no intention of being used by spider spin doctors to make it look like we make progress when it is just words. <br/>id love to know what you think but i cant ask.<br/>youd say oh ther e he goes again interfering and meddling in politics why doesnt he get on with the music and shut up.<br/>perhaps because i feel like a hypocrit if dont do anything, and equally feel like a hypocrit if i try getting involved.<br/>nobody wants to know. none of u s do, me included id love to forget about it like your average Times reader. wed all like it to go away. turn to to the rising sea and say come back later im busy right now.<br/>Blair has been uttering nonsense lately about kyoto and such, real la la stuff... looks like th eamerican right have finally eaten his mind... blah blah  why on earth would i meet this man? o r perhaps that is exactly why i should. but i dont have powers of persuasion, i just have temper and an acid tongue.<br/><br/>trust me i find this as dull as you do... politics is poison.. <br/>what do yout think i should do?<br/><br/>speak to you later
