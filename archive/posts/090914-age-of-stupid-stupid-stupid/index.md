hi<br/>there is a film that is getting a lot of attention call Aged of Stupid. i've seen it and it stays with you-<br/>especially in light of the Copenhagen summit coming up in December where our glorious leaders must decide how we structure our plans to tackle climate change.<br/>The global premier of it will happen on the 21st of september or 22nd depending on your time zone.<br/>There are cinemas participating in over 50 countries - If you want to be part of it, you can buy a ticket for the one nearest to you by going to the age of stupid website  <br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://www.ageofstupid.net/" target="_blank">www.ageofstupid.net</a><br/><br/>After the screening, there will be live discussion thing via global satellite link up<br/>and after that I will be playing Reckoner live from an undisclosed location.
