hope you are enjoying listening to the download of In Rainbows. <br/>its a relief to us all that finally its out there.<br/>its been a mad couple of weeks.. as i'm sure you can imagine...<br/><br/>"I love pop music to death..... Most great composers rely on folk music. I rely on pop music. <br/>I'm not saying I'm a great composer or that pop music is folk music. There's a whole endless thing going on out there. <br/>You make your little pond but if your pond isn't connected to the river, which isn't connected to an ocean, <br/>it's just going to dry up. It's just a little piss pool. I've lived too long to be happy in a pond." <br/><br/>I found this in WIRE magazine over a pint in the pub last night.. its Robert Wyatt
