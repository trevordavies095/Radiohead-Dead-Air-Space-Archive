  "body": "Hello<br>\r\nJust wanted to let you know what I've been up to during my downtime from Radiohead.<br>\r\nMy second solo album, \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.philipselway.com\">Weatherhouse</a>\" will be released on October 6th. I recorded this album from late January 2013 until late January this year with Adem Ilhan and Quinta. I loved every moment of it. Here is the first track from the record, 'Coming Up For Air':<br><br><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/154915466%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-VI6AM&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"170\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAlso, this weekend, I begin a run of shows with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/687700\">Rambert Dance Company</a> at their new home on the Southbank in London. Again working with Adem Ilhan and Quinta, we've written the score for a series of Merce Cunningham Events, set against the backdrop of Gerhard Richter's \"Cage\" paintings. The performances take place over the next three Saturdays: 28th June, 5th July and 12th July.<br>\r\nHope you enjoy what I've done.",
