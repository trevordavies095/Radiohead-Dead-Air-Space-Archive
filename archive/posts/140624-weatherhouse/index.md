Hello<br/>
Just wanted to let you know what I've been up to during my downtime from Radiohead.<br/>
My second solo album, "<a href="http://www.philipselway.com" target="_blank">Weatherhouse</a>" will be released on October 6th. I recorded this album from late January 2013 until late January this year with Adem Ilhan and Quinta. I loved every moment of it. Here is the first track from the record, 'Coming Up For Air':<br/><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="170" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/154915466%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-VI6AM&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true" width="100%"></iframe>

Also, this weekend, I begin a run of shows with <a href="http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/687700" target="_blank">Rambert Dance Company</a> at their new home on the Southbank in London. Again working with Adem Ilhan and Quinta, we've written the score for a series of Merce Cunningham Events, set against the backdrop of Gerhard Richter's "Cage" paintings. The performances take place over the next three Saturdays: 28th June, 5th July and 12th July.<br/>
Hope you enjoy what I've done.
