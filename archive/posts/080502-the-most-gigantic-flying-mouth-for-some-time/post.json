The list of tour dates will give you public transport information where available, and where not, there may be venue incentives for car sharing. There will also be weekly postings from Radiohead's production team on how the band has addressed their own touring carbon footprint and made it easier for fans to reduce theirs. You can discuss our successes and more importantly, our failings at <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.waste-central.com/groups\">waste-central</a>, post up more local travel information where we haven't and make friends with other people going to your show. <br><br>Hopefully see you on the tour!",
