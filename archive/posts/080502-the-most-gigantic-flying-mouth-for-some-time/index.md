Radiohead take to the road on Monday (via a plane, unfortunately) to start in Florida with the first show of their 2008 tour.<br/><br/>Following on from <a class="bol" href="http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/index.php?a=310" target="_blank">their posting on the 19th December</a> and the <a class="bol" href="http://www.radiohead.com/radiohead_bff.zip" target="_blank">commissioned report</a> on touring and CO2 generation, we've developed a new section of the site that gig goers can visit: <a class="bol" href="http://www.radiohead.com/themostgiganticflyingmouthforsometime" target="_blank">the most gigantic flying mouth for some time</a>.<br/><br/>Here you can try out our carbon calculator and compare different transport methods for getting to and from the venue. The list of tour dates will give you public transport information where available, and where not, there may be venue incentives for car sharing. There will also be weekly postings from Radiohead's production team on how the band has addressed their own touring carbon footprint and made it easier for fans to reduce theirs. You can discuss our successes and more importantly, our failings at <a class="bol" href="http://www.waste-central.com/groups" target="_blank">waste-central</a>, post up more local travel information where we haven't and make friends with other people going to your show. <br/><br/>Hopefully see you on the tour!
