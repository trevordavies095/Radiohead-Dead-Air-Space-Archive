I was very sad to hear the news of Adam Yauch's death yesterday.<br/>We looked up to the Beastie Boys a lot when we were starting out and how they maintained artistic control making wicked records but still were on a major label, and the Tibetan Freedom Concerts they organized had a very big influence on me personally and the way Adam conducted himself and dealt with it all impressed me a lot. He was a mellow and v smart guy. May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>On another note check this out&gt; people connecting the dots of our weird weather patterns, though the climate change deniers still frantically shout their voice is getting quieter.<br/><a class="bol" href="http://www.climatedots.org/" target="_blank">climate dots around the world</a><br/><br/>and some music.. <br/><br/>1.
