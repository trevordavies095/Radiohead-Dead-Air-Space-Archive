Hey <br/>We are bringing Greenpeace on the road with us..<br/>We support their campaign to save the Arctic from oil drilling and mining as the ice get thinner through global warming.<br/>Drawing a line somewhere in the ice saying, ok that's enough, no further. The madness stops here. Break this spell.<br/>If you are coming along i hope you can get time to go and talk to them.<br/><br/>Best wishesish<br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://www.savethearctic.org" target="_blank">www.savethearctic.org</a><br/><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4XpF04nximI?rel=0" width="560"></iframe>
