I woke up this morning to hear the Oliver Postgate has died, which makes me very sad. <br/>His childrens Tv shows changed my life and my childrens so we wish him well wherever it is he is off to next.<br/>He had a great website as well, was very politically minded.<br/>Anyone who is involved in the upcoming climate negotations in Poland might, in memory of him and all his amazing work, want to read this essay from 2006<br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://www.oliverpostgate.co.uk/archive16.html" target="_blank">Political Reality</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>
