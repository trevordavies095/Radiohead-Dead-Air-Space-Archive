Japhia Umuri, at just 21 years old, has already had a challenging life. His close knit family moved through five countries, from Rwanda, to live in South Africa. He started working with CRF at 16 years old, telling his story through radio. <br/><br/>Japhia is currently studying Economics at the University of the Western Cape. Sam and I went to meet Japhia on campus and speaking to him today, he said that he felt a burden lift through being able to tell this story. We spoke to Japhia for a couple of hours and asked him about his aspirations. His reply makes an apt and compelling summary to what has been, for us, an extraordinary enlightening trip. <br/><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F77108096" width="100%"></iframe><p>I have seen that something as low-tech and ubiquitous as radio can become a platform for the voices of young people, making them feel unique and special. <br/><br/>Thank you to everyone for your interest and continuing support, and thank you to Children's Radio Foundation (pictured below) for showing me what a fantastic future South Africa has through its youth. <br/></p>
