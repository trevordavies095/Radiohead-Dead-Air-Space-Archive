hello good people its sunday august 21 2005 and we're recording....... let me fill you in a little. so apart from a 3 and a half week tour to the other side of the world in april of 2004 the rest of that year was a dormant one for us<br/>......... we needed a break ....... the end of another 3 album cycle...... they're not planned like that but thats how it seems to be. we needed to be at home with our families ....... lots of babies too. so we reconvened in mid - february and since then we've been trying to kick start the old beast ...... you don't realize once you've stopped how hard it is to regain the momentum ........ you literally get out the habit of doing it........ but often the only way to stop repeating yourself is to stop doing that thing, walk away from it ....... sometimes you have to go away in order to come back..... so here we are in the studio recording and it feels right. its only day 4, its very early days but really good things are happening .......lots of deconstructing and reassembling. we've been working on mornin' m' lud and pigsee.
