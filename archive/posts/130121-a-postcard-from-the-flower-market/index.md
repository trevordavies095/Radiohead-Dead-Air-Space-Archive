<p>This morning we all reconvened at the slave lodge museum - Sam, 
myself, the young trainers and two teachers Lesedi and Nina. We learnt 
about the &Atilde;&cent;&euro;~postcard&Atilde;&cent;&euro;  format, a way of making a programme for radio that 
sets the scene of a place. We learnt how to describe the place using 
sound, interview people and include your own feelings and reactions. 
Have a look at the white board (pictured below) to find out more about 
'postcards'. <br/><br/>It was a lively, fun two hour session broken up 
with dancing and group games (don&Atilde;&cent;&euro; t ask how I did), after which we split
 up into three reporting teams to go and make a 5 minute &Atilde;&cent;&euro;~postcard&Atilde;&cent;&euro;  
somewhere nearby. Our team - Lisa, Rishie and Sithem&Atilde;&cent;&euro;"Biso (pictured 
below) - chose to go to the flower market on Adderley Street, near to 
the Slave Museum. <br/><br/>Each reporting team of three was divided into 
presenter, producer and a technician. There was a lot of planning before
 we recorded - where we should go, who we should talk to. You can listen
 to the postcard we made below along with a post-recording chat that Sam
 had with Lisa, Rishie and Sithem&Atilde;&cent;&euro;"Biso too.</p><p><br/></p><p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F75880323" width="100%"><br/></iframe></p><p>One of the important things to say about the CRF broadcasts is that the 
aim is to make as few edits as possible. Not all of the radio stations 
have computers, so it&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s all about low tech production. It was like the 
live flow of a gig &Atilde;&cent;&euro;" make a mistake, move on! </p>
