  "body": "<p>This morning we all reconvened at the slave lodge museum - Sam, \r\nmyself, the young trainers and two teachers Lesedi and Nina. We learnt \r\nabout the Ã¢&#8364;~postcardÃ¢&#8364;  format, a way of making a programme for radio that \r\nsets the scene of a place. We learnt how to describe the place using \r\nsound, interview people and include your own feelings and reactions. \r\nHave a look at the white board (pictured below) to find out more about \r\n'postcards'. <br><br>It was a lively, fun two hour session broken up \r\nwith dancing and group games (donÃ¢&#8364; t ask how I did), after which we split\r\n up into three reporting teams to go and make a 5 minute Ã¢&#8364;~postcardÃ¢&#8364;  \r\nsomewhere nearby. Our team - Lisa, Rishie and SithemÃ¢&#8364;\"Biso (pictured \r\nbelow) - chose to go to the flower market on Adderley Street, near to \r\nthe Slave Museum. <br><br>Each reporting team of three was divided into \r\npresenter, producer and a technician. There was a lot of planning before\r\n we recorded - where we should go, who we should talk to. You can listen\r\n to the postcard we made below along with a post-recording chat that Sam\r\n had with Lisa, Rishie and SithemÃ¢&#8364;\"Biso too.</p><p><br></p><p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F75880323\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\"><br></iframe></p><p>One of the important things to say about the CRF broadcasts is that the \r\naim is to make as few edits as possible. Not all of the radio stations \r\nhave computers, so itÃ¢&#8364; s all about low tech production. It was like the \r\nlive flow of a gig Ã¢&#8364;\" make a mistake, move on! </p>",
