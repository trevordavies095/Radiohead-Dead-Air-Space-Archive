  "body": "Dear Sir or Madam<br><br>This is to inform you of the release of two more bits of work shortly.<br>They are loosely under the <strong>Thom Yorke</strong> name this time, although these days its all getting kind of blurry.<br><strong>FeelingPulledApartbyHorses</strong> is written & played by Jonny and I and is a radical rework of an old tune thats been kicking around without a home since 2001? i think.<br><strong>The Hollow Earth</strong> is a bass menace that was born out of the Eraser period but needed a little more time.<br>Both were produced by <strong>Nigel Godrich</strong> as ever. And mastered by Bob Ludwig.<br>They are being put out on 12\" with sliced sleeve by <strong>Stanley and Tchock</strong>.<br>My sources tell me this will be available from the 21st of September if you're interested.. On sale in the <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.waste.uk.com/Store/waste-radiohead-dii-11-10075-a+physical.html\">w.a.s.t.e part of our website</a> (with a gratis download.)<br>Or you can go buy it in a good record shop if you are lucky enough to have one near you.<br>Then later on there will be like a normal download thing i think around the 6th of Oct through the usual channels.<br><br>And so it goes. all the best",
