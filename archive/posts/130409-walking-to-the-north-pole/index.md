<p><a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/north-pole-expedition/" target="">NOrth Pole Expedition</a>&nbsp;<br/></p><p>A volunteer team from Greenpeace are currently making their way to the North Pole. It is such a brave thing to take on! They will plant a flag and millions of signatures from you and me demanding the Arctic be made a reserve for us all and future generations. Free from Oil drilling and over fishing. Watch their progress and sign up if you think its a good idea. I really hope they make it..</p>
