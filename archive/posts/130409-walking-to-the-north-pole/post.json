It is such a brave thing to take on! They will plant a flag and millions of signatures from you and me demanding the Arctic be made a reserve for us all and future generations. Free from Oil drilling and over fishing. Watch their progress and sign up if you think its a good idea. I really hope they make it..</p>",
