Here's a new track called Staircase, taken from our upcoming 'From The Basement' session:<br/><br/><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFTLxkMmY4M?si=20o5gPyjZ-zuH0_b" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><br/><br/>And no, you're not seeing double. The doppelganger drummers are myself and Clive Deamer. Clive has long been one of my favourite drummers and so I was really excited when he agreed to perform with us. Hope you like what we've all done.
