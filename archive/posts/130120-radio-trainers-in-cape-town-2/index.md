<p>Sam and I flew into Cape Town at half eight this morning and were met by Mike Rahfaldt, Executive Director at CRF.&nbsp; He took us on a short tour of the city, starting with a drive past <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khayelitsha" target="">Khayelitsha</a>, a township by the airport, housing one million people under corrugated iron shacks and stacked small new builds built by the government.<br/><br/>We joined a training session for 14 youth radio trainers and producers from all over South Africa (pictured above), hosted by Lesedi and Nina from CRF. It was held in a first floor reception room of the <a href="http://www.iziko.org.za/static/page/the-history-of-the-building" target="">Iziko Slave Lodge Museum</a>, formerly the colonial offices and one of the oldest buildings in Cape Town. The trainers had come from radio stations all over South Africa (we&Atilde;&cent;&euro; ll be visiting some of them over the next fortnight) and have been here this week to learn and practise different radio techniques, which they&Atilde;&cent;&euro; ll take to their own community radio stations. &nbsp;<br/><br/>You can hear an interview Sam&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s just done with youth trainer Baby&Atilde;&cent;&euro;"Girl, from Moutse Community Radio Station in Limpopo. &nbsp;<br/></p><p>
