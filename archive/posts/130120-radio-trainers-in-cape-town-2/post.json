It was held in a first floor reception room of the <a href=\"http://www.iziko.org.za/static/page/the-history-of-the-building\" target=\"\">Iziko Slave Lodge Museum</a>, formerly the colonial offices and one of the oldest buildings in Cape Town. The trainers had come from radio stations all over South Africa (weÃ¢&#8364; ll be visiting some of them over the next fortnight) and have been here this week to learn and practise different radio techniques, which theyÃ¢&#8364; ll take to their own community radio stations. &nbsp;<br><br>You can hear an interview SamÃ¢&#8364; s just done with youth trainer BabyÃ¢&#8364;\"Girl, from Moutse Community Radio Station in Limpopo. &nbsp;<br></p><p>\r\n<iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F75732863\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br>BabyÃ¢&#8364;\"Girl loves working with the young reporters, because they come up with such brilliant new ideas for broadcasts. <br><br>Tomorrow weÃ¢&#8364; re going back to Khayelitsha, this time with all the radio trainers, as they go and interview people living in the township.&nbsp; <br></p>",
