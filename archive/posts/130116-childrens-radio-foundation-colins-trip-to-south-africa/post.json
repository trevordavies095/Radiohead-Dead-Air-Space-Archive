  "body": "Hello and I'd like to let everyone know I'm off on an adventure to South Africa on Saturday. &nbsp;I've been working with a charity based there, called the <a href=\"http://www.childrensradiofoundation.org/\">Children's Radio Foundation</a>, which works with young people in half a dozen countries in Africa to give them journalistic and broadcasting skills, and a voice to tell their stories. &nbsp;I'm going for 11 days to visit some of the places where the CRF is working with youth groups, hospitals and radio stations in South Africa. <b>You can follow my trip <a href=\"http://crf.waste.uk.com/\">HERE</a></b>. &nbsp;I will be putting up some pictures, and blogging about the journey as I go along. &nbsp;You can see and hear some of the stories by following the Vimeo link, and Soundcloud too.</p><p>I'm very excited to be going, and I hope you will enjoy following my journey on the site. &nbsp;I'm working with CRF because I've always believed in the importance of curiosity, and I grew in a home that was passionate about ' Radio ', as a window to the world outside. In my day job as a musician, I've always loved travelling, meeting people, and making connections with them about all our lives. &nbsp; CRF does all of this this brilliantly, through its radio and journalism training. &nbsp;CRF informs and enlightens everyone's lives - the reporter, interviewee, and the listener, wherever they may be. &nbsp; I'll also be checking out some music too, so keep an eye on the site! \"</p>",
