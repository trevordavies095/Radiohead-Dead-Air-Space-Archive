so yes rumour has it that the canadians came to the copenhagen summit demanding to increase their co2 emmissions.<br/>principally cuz of the tar sands and how much money the faceless motherfuckers in the oil industry stand to make out of it.. who are obviously bankrolling the government there. <br/>i find it hard to correlate this all with the canadians i know who are very forward thinking.. <br/>the frightening thing about it is that just such a project could send the climate over the tipping point.<br/>here's a link.. but just google if you wanna know more<br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://peopleandplanet.org/tarsands" target="_blank">people and planet on tar sands</a><br/><br/>....i try to imagine what it must be like to work in the political lobby office of BP or whatever (ok not often).. must be nice to not give a shit... i've met some people involved in the oil industry they seem nice enough... u know.. <br/>but hey, they might cry, were all answerable to the shareholders.. <br/>err hang on isnt that most of us? pension funds etc? tricky. but then again not really. what use is a fuckin pension when there aint nowhere to live?<br/><br/>an yway<br/>this is an office chart for all u shareholders out there&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Intro: Live At Skateland (1986)	Cutty Ranks<br/>Brothers Gonna Work It Out	Public Enemy	Fear of a Black Planet<br/>Cyclic Bit		Raymond Scott	<br/>Audience No. 2	Autolux<br/>New York Is Killing Me (Original Clapping Version) Gil Scott-Heron<br/>Natty	    DVA		<br/>Sing	 Four Tet	<br/>Ambre	Nils Frahm	<br/>Take Me Back	Aloe Blacc		<br/><br/><br/>
