  "body": "<p>\"Re Eme Pele Go Go Ntshetsa Pele\" - 'We're ahead of the pack to show you the way'<br><br>Vaaltar\r\n FM is the community radio station for Taung, an area known as 'the \r\nlions' home'. Taung is larger than Kuruman (where we were the day \r\nbefore) and Vaaltar FM has a reach of 230,000 listeners. Vaaltar has \r\nbeen on the air for 13 years, a massive achievement. There are 35 people\r\n working at the station, with a total annual budget of about Ãƒ‚Ãƒ‚£4,000 for\r\n wages and Ãƒ‚Ãƒ‚£3,000 for running costs. Funds are raised through local \r\nadvertising and hosting government broadcasts, such as budget \r\nannouncements from Cape Town.<br><br>The youth reporters are led by a \r\ntrainer called 'Notorious', a young presenter with his own African music\r\n show every Monday. We heard a great trail for Notorious' show, listen \r\nbelow. <br><br><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76516353\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br></p><p>Notorious hosts DJ sessions, with local producers coming into the station to spin their latest&nbsp; tunes live on air. <br><br>In addition to his 'day job', Notorious also leads the youth radio show 'WhatÃ¢&#8364; s Up'. ItÃ¢&#8364; s currently a pre-recorded show, but from February this\r\n year itÃ¢&#8364; s going to go out live, which will be a real buzz for the kids.\r\n HereÃ¢&#8364; s one of the Public Service Announcements they recorded for the \r\nshow, warning listeners about drink and drugs. </p><p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76516284\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\"></iframe><br>Lesedi led the children in a refresher course on radio reporting and presenting different audio formats, whilst Notorious offered them encouragement and support. I had a quick interview with three of the girls from the team (incidentally, the group was made up of seven girls and one very brave boy) and an 11 year old girl called 'Peace', who was new to the group, asked me some questions. It was her first time ever at the station and the other more experienced children pitched in and helped her with the interview. <br><br>Everyone was so pleased and excited that we were all there, making great radio and sharing it with the listeners.<br></p>\r\n",
