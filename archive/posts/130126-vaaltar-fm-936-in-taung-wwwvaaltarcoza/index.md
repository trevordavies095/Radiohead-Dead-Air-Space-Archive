<p>"Re Eme Pele Go Go Ntshetsa Pele" - 'We're ahead of the pack to show you the way'<br/><br/>Vaaltar
 FM is the community radio station for Taung, an area known as 'the 
lions' home'. Taung is larger than Kuruman (where we were the day 
before) and Vaaltar FM has a reach of 230,000 listeners. Vaaltar has 
been on the air for 13 years, a massive achievement. There are 35 people
 working at the station, with a total annual budget of about &Atilde;&fnof;&sbquo;&Atilde;&fnof;&sbquo;&pound;4,000 for
 wages and &Atilde;&fnof;&sbquo;&Atilde;&fnof;&sbquo;&pound;3,000 for running costs. Funds are raised through local 
advertising and hosting government broadcasts, such as budget 
announcements from Cape Town.<br/><br/>The youth reporters are led by a 
trainer called 'Notorious', a young presenter with his own African music
 show every Monday. We heard a great trail for Notorious' show, listen 
below. <br/><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76516353" width="100%"></iframe><br/></p><p>Notorious hosts DJ sessions, with local producers coming into the station to spin their latest&nbsp; tunes live on air. <br/><br/>In addition to his 'day job', Notorious also leads the youth radio show 'What&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s Up'. It&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s currently a pre-recorded show, but from February this
 year it&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s going to go out live, which will be a real buzz for the kids.
 Here&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s one of the Public Service Announcements they recorded for the 
show, warning listeners about drink and drugs. </p><p><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76516284" width="100%"></iframe><br/>Lesedi led the children in a refresher course on radio reporting and presenting different audio formats, whilst Notorious offered them encouragement and support. I had a quick interview with three of the girls from the team (incidentally, the group was made up of seven girls and one very brave boy) and an 11 year old girl called 'Peace', who was new to the group, asked me some questions. It was her first time ever at the station and the other more experienced children pitched in and helped her with the interview. <br/><br/>Everyone was so pleased and excited that we were all there, making great radio and sharing it with the listeners.<br/></p>
