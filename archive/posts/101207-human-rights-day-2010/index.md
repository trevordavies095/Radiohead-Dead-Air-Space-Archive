December 10 is Human Rights Day, so ..... The good people of the Free Tibet Movement have decided to highlight the plight of the Chinese writer and holder of the 2010 Nobel peace prize, Liu Xiaobo .. he's currently in prison in China. By clicking on the link below you can email the leaders of the G8 to apply pressure on the Chinese Government to release him .... you know it makes sense...<br/>Free Liu Xiaobo, Free Tibetan Heroes<br/><br/><a href="http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5380/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=4842">http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5380/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=4842</a>
