<p>Here's an audio slideshow from Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Lesedi drove us to visit a young people's health centre on 'Site C' in Khayelitsha, the huge settlement just by Cape Town Airport.</p>
<p>We met up with Lulu, who works as a counsellor and Ruth, who runs the Children's Radio Foundation project in partnership with Medecins Sans Frontieres.</p>

<p>We walked through some of the streets of Khayelitsha to the local library with two youth radio reporters, Zible and Nonjongo, who have both trained on the Children's Radio Foundation project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We enjoyed some of the street vendors&Atilde;&cent;&euro;  tasty beef barbecue and ginger beer, then got &nbsp;back in the car and drove to Lookout Hill to see some of the views across the settlement.</p>
<p> Nonjongo told us what a hassle it is for her to get to college from Khayelitsha, three buses and a taxi, because that&Atilde;&cent;&euro; s how the infrastructure was set up under apartheid &Atilde;&cent;&euro;" to pen you in and slow you down every day.</p>
