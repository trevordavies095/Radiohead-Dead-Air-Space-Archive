Over the past couple of months, a number of people have asked if there is anything they can do in memory of Scott. Scott's parents have now created the Scott Johnson Bursary Fund for Young Musicians. This will fund musical equipment for young people in Rotherham in the UK, where Scott grew up. If you would like to find out more, or would like to make a donation, then please follow this link:<br/><br/><a href="http://scottjohnsonbursary.com">http://scottjohnsonbursary.com</a>/<br/><br/>Many thanks<br/><br/>X
