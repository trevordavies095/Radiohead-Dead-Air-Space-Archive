Hello everyone,<br/> <br/>As you will probably have heard the roof over the stage collapsed at our show in Toronto killing crew member Scott Johnson and injuring three other crew members. Whilst we all are dealing with the grief and shock ensuing from this terrible accident there are also many practical considerations to deal with &amp; consequently we have to try and reschedule the following shows:<br/> <br/>June<br/>30 Roma Hippodrome Capanelle<br/> <br/>July<br/>1 Firenze Parco delle Cascine<br/>3 Bologna Arena Parco Nord<br/>4 Codroipo Villa Manin<br/>6 Berlin Wuhlheide<br/>7 Berlin Wuhlheide<br/>9 St Triphon Carriere des Andonces<br/> <br/>We aim to announce the new dates for these shows on Wednesday 27th of June and will also supply information on how to obtain refunds on tickets  if you cannot come to the show on the new date.  <br/> <br/>We will start playing live again at Les Arenes  Nimes, Bilbao BBK festival  and Lisbon Optimus Alive festival.   <br/> <br/>We will make every effort to offer the fans the very best show possible under the circumstances - thanks for your understanding and support.
