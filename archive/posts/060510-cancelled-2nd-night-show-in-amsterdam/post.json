  "body": "We're very sorry, but because of a sudden family bereavement, we have had to cancel tonight's second concert at the Heineken Concert Hall.  We are trying to re -  schedule the concert in Amsterdam later on in the summer.  We will keep you posted here, and in the usual media.  We are especially sorry to those people who have made a special effort to travel and see us play.  At least it's been a sunny day here, and there's no finer place in the sun than Amsterdam.",
