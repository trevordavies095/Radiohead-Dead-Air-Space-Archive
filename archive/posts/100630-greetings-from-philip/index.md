Hello<br/> <br/>I just wanted to let you know what I've been up to recently in my idle moments in Radiohead.<br/>Over the past year or so, I've written and recorded an album which I've called Familial. It will be released on Bella Union on 30th August, except for USA and Canada, where it will be released on 31st August through Nonesuch.<br/>If you'd like to download a free track from my album then please go to <a class="bol" href="http://www.philipselway.com" target="_blank">www.philipselway.com</a>. The song is called By Some Miracle and is available now.<br/>I'm also doing some shows and there's information about those on the website too.<br/>Thank you x
<p class="signature">Philip</p>
