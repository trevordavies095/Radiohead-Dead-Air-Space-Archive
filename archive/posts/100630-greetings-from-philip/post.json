It will be released on Bella Union on 30th August, except for USA and Canada, where it will be released on 31st August through Nonesuch.<br>If you'd like to download a free track from my album then please go to <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.philipselway.com\">www.philipselway.com</a>. The song is called By Some Miracle and is available now.<br>I'm also doing some shows and there's information about those on the website too.<br>Thank you x",
