<p>Hello all.</p><p>So in the midst of yet more weird weather and the beginning of another year it feels right to put out a song called ..... <i>Judge Jury and Executioner</i> from Amok. It's up on youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4tW3mhp9io" target="">here&gt;</a> - I hope you like it.</p><p>The flip side of the release is a tune called <i>S.A.D.</i></p><p><a href="http://www.atomsforpeace.info">Amok</a> is out 25th of Feb.</p>
