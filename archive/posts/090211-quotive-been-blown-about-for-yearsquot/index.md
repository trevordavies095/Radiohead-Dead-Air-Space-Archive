Saw <a class="bol" href="http://www.wire-sound.com/" target="_blank">Magazine</a> play last night in Oxford. It was remarkable....nearly 30 years since they last played, and they were everything you could hope for. It was strangely free of nostalgia - just great songs, well played. <br/><br/>The one mention of their past - a tribute to the memory of the remarkable musician <a class="bol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGeoch" target="_blank">John McGeoch</a> - was very affecting, but also part of this sense they had of  'we know this music's great, you know it's great, and it goes like this' - nothing smug, or especially triumphant - it was just obvious to everyone there. They opened with "The light pours out of me" and didn't falter once.<br/><br/> About time they got recognized for their song writing (which informs so much of what radiohead do - no guitarist inspired me more that John McGeoch), and live performances (which we were too young to have seen). Go and see them this time around if you can get a ticket (or can shamelessly blag one like I did....)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
