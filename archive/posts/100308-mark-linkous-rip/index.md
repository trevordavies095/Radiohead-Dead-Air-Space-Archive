I was very sad to hear the news that Mark Linkous has died.  He and his band toured with us in Europe, at the start of OK Computer, and they were great every night.  His first two records were very important to me, and I carried his music from the tour into my life, and my friends' lives too.  He was softly spoken, with an Old South courtesy I hadn't heard before:  he introduced me to Daniel Johnston's music, and the West Virginian writing of Pinckney Benedict. Mark wrote and played some beautiful music, and we're lucky to have it.  Rest in Peace.
