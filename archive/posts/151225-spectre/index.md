Last year we were asked to write a tune for the Bond movie Spectre.<br/>Yes we were. It didn't work out, but became something of our own, which we love very much.<br/>As the year closes we thought you might like to hear it.<br/>Merry Christmas. May the force be with you.<br/><br/><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/239061508&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false" width="100%"></iframe>
