Demand for tickets has far exceeded supply and all Radiohead's headline shows are now sold out.<br/><br/>Strict rules are in place to try and reduce online touting, but inevitably some will find their way onto secondary ticketing sites at inflated prices.<br/><br/>To those thinking about buying a ticket from a secondary site, PLEASE CAREFULLY CHECK THE <a href="http://www.wasteheadquarters.com/schedule">ORIGINAL RULES FOR THE VENUE CONCERNED</a>; MANY OF THE TICKETS WILL BE NAMED AND STRINGENT ID CHECKS WILL BE IN PLACE SO YOU RISK BEING REFUSED ENTRY TO THE VENUE.<br/><br/>We hope you understand the need to put such measures in place to give more fans a chance to get to the shows.<br/><br/>
