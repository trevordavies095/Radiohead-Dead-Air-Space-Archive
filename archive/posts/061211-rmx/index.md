For anyone who has heard The Eraser, there are some remixes coming.<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>I got excited. I've been listening through. I mean. There's some freaky shit.<br/><br/>They may start appearing soon. Gradually. Briefly.<br/>Just a taste. And then gone.<br/><br/>On <a class="bol" href="http://www.theeraser.net" target="_blank">www.theeraser.net</a><br/><br/>First there is Surgeon's Rmx of The Clock.<br/>This was the one that made me think, we got to start getting these out.<br/>I was chuffed he wanted to do it as think he is a MASTER.<br/>He has turned it into something really hard. And disco.<br/>Well what i call disco anyhow.<br/>It made me very proud.<br/><br/>I hope it gets played in a club somewhere.<br/>Not that i get out much nowadays.<br/><br/><br/>Peace to us all during the festive season.
