BBC 6 Music - 8 years old today. Something worth celebrating: I mean, when Chris Moyles and Ken Bruce aren't for you - and Radios 1 and 2 strive to appeal to ever younger and <a class="bol" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/mar/10/bbc-6-music-bruce-dickinson" target="_blank">older listeners</a> - where else can you turn during the day? <br/><br/>Happy Birthday 6 Music, and all you other nerdy music lovers everywhere....now let's <a class="bol" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=278123313911" target="_blank">fight</a> for many happy returns.
