<br/>The <a class="bol" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071" target="_blank">Berkeley Earth Project</a> has concluded that the Earth is definitely warming.. <br/>Set up after a bizarre last ditch campaign to question/sabotage the science of global warming in 2009 around 'climategate' this further undermines those who continue to tell us what we'd like to hear, that it ain't real and there's nothing to be done. <br/>Will it draw a big black thick line under this guff so that we can finally and seriously move on and start to change the way our world functions????<br/><br/><br/><br/>"meanwhile .."<br/><br/>here's some music... <br/><br/>1.
