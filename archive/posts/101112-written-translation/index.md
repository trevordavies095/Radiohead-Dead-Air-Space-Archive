<a href="http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/11/10/jonny-greenwood-radiohead-almost-finished-with-new-album/">http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/11/10/jonny-greenwood-radiohead-almost-finished-with-new-album/</a><br/><br/>I think this italian writer (referred to here) has, either through over-enthusiasm, or frustration at all my non-committal answers, mistranslated me a little....in fact we haven't quite finished the album - in the studio at the moment - nor have we yet considered any touring. The plan is to have no plan until the record is finished....hope that's a little clearer!<br/><br/>
