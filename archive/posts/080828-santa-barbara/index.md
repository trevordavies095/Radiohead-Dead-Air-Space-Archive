Hello!  To celebrate the end of a brilliant tour, we're going to webcast the last show here in America.  We'll be playing live in Santa Barbara, at <a class="bol" href="http://sbbowl.com/" target="_blank">the Bowl</a>. It's one of our favourite places to play; I think we've ended tours there  before, once even playing a cover of ' cinnamon girl '.   It's not too big, in fact it's very intimate, a small arena with a dirt floor, set in pretty countryside.  It should be a special night, for lots of reasons, and we're going to try and share as much of it as we can on the webcast. Nigel, our producer, will be helping out getting it to you, so if it goes wrong....It's live! <br/><br/>Thank you so much to everyone who's come and seen us this year;  it has truly been the most special and exciting tour for all of us.<br/><br/>Webcast details to follow...<br/>x
