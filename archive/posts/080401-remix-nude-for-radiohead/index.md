To celebrate this week's single release (we still have those in England) Radiohead have broken up the song 'Nude' into pieces for you to remix.<br/><br/>For those of you who enjoy this sort of thing, you can buy the separate components or 'stems' (bass, voice, guitar, strings/FX and drums) and remix your own version of the song. You can do this by adding your own beats and instrumentation or just remixing the original parts. More information is at <a class="bol" href="http://www.radioheadremix.com/information/" target="_blank">www.radioheadremix.com/information</a>.<br/><br/>You can buy the stems at <a class="bol" href="http://www.radioheadremix.com/buy/" target="_blank">www.radioheadremix.com/buy</a><br/><br/>You can upload your finished mixes at <a class="bol" href="http://www.radioheadremix.com" target="_blank">www.radioheadremix.com</a> and be judged and even voted on by 'the public'. You can also create a widget allowing votes from your own website, Facebook or MySpace page to be sent through too.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it!<br/><br/>For those of you who aren't that way inclined, Nude is also available in its entirety on CD and 7 inch (UK release) at the usual retail outlets.
