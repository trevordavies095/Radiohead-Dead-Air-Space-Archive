You may have heard that I have a new project called <a class="bol" href="http://www.atomsforpeace.info" target="_blank">Atoms for Peace</a>.<br/><br/>The name comes from some shows of The Eraser that happened a couple of years ago with Mauro, Joey, Nigel and Flea.<br/><br/>We got a big buzz from them and discovered loads of energy from transforming the music from electronic to live, and so afterwards, we carried on for a few days in the studio and decided to make it a loose, on-going thing. <br/>Immersed in the area between the two.electronic and live.<br/><br/>The first tune we'd like you to hear is <a class="bol" href="http://www.atomsforpeace.info" target="_blank">Default</a><br/>A 12" vinyl version will follow next month and an album will eventually follow that next year.
