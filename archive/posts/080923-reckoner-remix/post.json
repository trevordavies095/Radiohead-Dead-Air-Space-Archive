You can get the stems (the different instruments/elements) from <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=291094944&s=143444\">here</a>.<br><br>Sample, cut, take the sounds, whatever. Play it in a club. Or your room. Then if you want you can upload your finished mixes to <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.radioheadremix.com\">www.radioheadremix.com</a> and be judged by everyone else. YOu can create a widget allowing votes from your own site, Facebook or MySpace to be sent through too.<br><br>Have fun.<br>X",
