To coincide with asking radio stations to think about playing Reckoner we are breaking up the tune into pieces for you to remix.<br/><br/>After the insane response we got from the Nude remix stems and the site that was dedicated to your remixes...<div style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 30px;">Unique visitors: 6,193,776, Page Views: 29,090,134, Hits: 58,340,512, Bandwidth: 10.666 Terabytes, Number of mixes: 2,252, Number of votes: 461,090, Number of track listens: 1,745,304</div>...we thought it only fair to do the same with a tune that at least is in 4/4. You can get the stems (the different instruments/elements) from <a class="bol" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=291094944&amp;s=143444" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>Sample, cut, take the sounds, whatever. Play it in a club. Or your room. Then if you want you can upload your finished mixes to <a class="bol" href="http://www.radioheadremix.com" target="_blank">www.radioheadremix.com</a> and be judged by everyone else. YOu can create a widget allowing votes from your own site, Facebook or MySpace to be sent through too.<br/><br/>Have fun.<br/>X
