<br/>"The economy is rolling along an endless plateau, and consumers are bored with the view. Something strange is needed to get them to sit up." <br/><br/>"The consumerist society is a kind of soft police state. We think we have a choice, but everything is compulsory. We have to keep buying or we fail as citizens."<br/><br/>"The danger is that consumerism will need something close to fascism in order to keep growing."<br/><br/>"We're like bored children. We've been on holiday for too long, and we've been given too many presents."<br/><br/>from <b>Kingdom Come</b> by J G Ballard
