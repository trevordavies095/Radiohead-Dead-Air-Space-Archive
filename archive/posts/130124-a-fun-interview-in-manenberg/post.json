  "body": "<p>We spent the morning at the Slave Lodge Museum for a final round up of all the training carried out by the amazing Nina, Lesedi and Yumna. Then later in the afternoon, Lesedi drove Sam and I to the township of Manenberg, 20 minutes outside of Cape Town. We had an appointment to meet some of the youngest radio reporters at a youth community centre, funded by CRF's UK office and run by Gwen and Linda. <br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After meeting all the kids, some as young as seven, we settled into a back room for a great interview - one of the most fun I've ever done. &nbsp;A lot of the children asking questions were more interested in my family than the usual interviewers. They asked me for my kids' names, the names of their teachers back in England, as well as my favourite story books - Grimms Tales. A lot of love for Little Red Riding Hood!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F76118460\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\"><br>\r\n</iframe></p>\r\n<p>The children also wanted to listen to some Radiohead, so we played 'Reckoner' and 'High and Dry'. &nbsp;Their feedback: they liked the groove on 'Reckoner' but preferred the song 'High and Dry'. Astute A&amp;R work. And great technical work by Jade (pictured below) on the recorder!</p>\r\n\t\t                ",
