n April 8th, China sentenced two Tibetans, Lobsang Gyaltsen and Loyak, to death for their alleged involvement in last year's protests in Lhasa. Two others, Phuntsok and Kangtsuk, were also sentenced to death but with a two year reprieve, and Dawa Sangpo was sentenced to life imprisonment.<br/> <br/>These harsh sentences signal an alarming escalation in the Chinese government's campaign to punish and intimidate Tibetans who dare to speak out against Chinese rule.<br/> <br/>Without a reprieve, Lobsang Gyaltsen and Loyak could be executed any day now. Help save their lives by taking action now.<br/> <br/>Please take action now by sending this urgent action to the Minister of Justice demanding that the death sentences are quashed with immediate effect. <br/><br/><a class="bol" href="http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5380/t/5114/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=598" target="_blank">http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5380/t/5114/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=598</a>
