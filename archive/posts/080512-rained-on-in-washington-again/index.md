To everyone who made it, and put up with the torrents on the lawn, and came early to catch the Liars and our show, thank you so much for braving the deluge.  I hope you heard what you came for, the music and lights diverting you from the wet.   We got out of there around three am, and the pic shows Jonny waiting in the loading bay whilst the water streams across the tarmac.  We've had floods at Bull Creek, lightning at the RFK stadium, so there must be some kind of Biblical fix between us and DC.  Frogs next time?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
