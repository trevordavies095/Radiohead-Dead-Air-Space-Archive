"While clouds of smoke by day and the glow of flames by night mark burning towns, the sky over the neighbouring vicinity is clear; where the screams of tortured prisoners are heard in one place, bankers count their coins... Somewhere else."<br/>- Barbara Tuchman, 'A Distant Mirror', pub. Alfred A. Knopf, 1978
