Hello<br/><br/>Next month, on the 10th and 11th November, I will be doing a couple of shows of my solo material at The Pegasus Theatre in Oxford to mark the start of their 50th Anniversary. I'm a patron of the theatre and these shows are fundraisers to support the fantastic and really valuable work that Pegasus does in providing access to the creative arts for young people. It's a wonderfully intimate place to see a show, so if you fancy coming along, I'd love to see you there. Tickets cost &Atilde;&fnof;&sbquo;&pound;25 and are available from my store here:<br/><br/><a href="http://tickets.philipselway.com/Store/DisplayItems.html">http://tickets.philipselway.com/Store/DisplayItems.html</a><br/><br/>Or the Pegasus ticket store here:<br/><br/><a href="http://tickets.pegasustheatre.org.uk/Productions/Performances.aspx">http://tickets.pegasustheatre.org.uk/Productions/Performances.aspx</a><br/><br/>X
