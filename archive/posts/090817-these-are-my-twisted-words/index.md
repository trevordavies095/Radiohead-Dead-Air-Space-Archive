So here's a new song, called 'These Are My Twisted Words'.<br/><br/>We've been recording for a while, and this was one of the first we finished.<br/>We're pretty proud of it.<br/><br/>There's other stuff in various states of completion, but this is one we've been practising, and which we'll probably play at this summer's concerts. Hope you like it.<br/><br/>Download the audio <a class="bol" href="http://store.wasteheadquarters.com/index.php/these-are-my-twisted-words-mp3.html" target="_blank">here</a> or torrent <a class="bol" href="http://www.mininova.org/get/2846416" target="_blank">here</a>.
