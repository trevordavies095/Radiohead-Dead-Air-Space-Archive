well ... i am truly disgusted about the way things have ended here. if you read in tommorrows headlines that a deal was reached?? remember it was nothing like what was needed and was filed by a bored complicit press who needed to show something for two weeks of crap.. and that it reflected the wests inability to lead decisively. <br/>that it will make alarm bells ring throughout the world. <br/>we have no international agreement. this is all too too late. <br/>i feel deeply traumatized by the whole experience. if you'd been there you would also have been.
