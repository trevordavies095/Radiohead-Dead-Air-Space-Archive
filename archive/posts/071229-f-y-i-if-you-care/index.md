for your information&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/><br/><br/>we did not ask for a load of cash from our old record label EMI to re- sign.<br/>that is a L I E.<br/>The Times in the UK should check its facts before it prints such dirt.<br/><br/>whAT we WANTED WAS some control over OUR WOrK and how it was used in the future by them-<br/>that seemed REASONAblE to us, <br/>as we cared about it a great deal.<br/><br/>Mr Hands was not interested.<br/>So neither were we.<br/><br/>We made the sign of the cross and walked away. Sadly.<br/><br/>We are extremely upset that this crap is being spread about.<br/><br/>To bedigging up such bullshit, or more politely airing yer dirty laundry in public, <br/>seems a very strange way for the head of an international record label to be proceeding. <br/><br/>On a happier note we took no 'BRead-HEAd' advances at all from both independent labels XL and TBD  for our new record. <br/><br/>So judge for yourself.<br/><br/>AND we are really excited to be working with them. SHock!<br/><br/>AT least they do not behave like confused bulls in a china shop.<br/><br/>much love<br/><br/>thom<br/>x<br/><br/><br/>
