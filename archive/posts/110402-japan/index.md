for a while I have felt the need to write something for our fans, I am very fond of japan and feel awful seeing what has happened since the earthquake and tsunami...<br/>my friends in Tokyo tell me there are now big powercuts and though the city is still functioning there is a lot of re-evaluating going on. Tokyo the temple to light and power is something different now.<br/>that such a fast paced hyperkinetic place can be brought to it's knees is shocking even before the worries over radiation from the reactors. <br/>it is hard to imagine how it must feel<br/>to have witnessed such devastation by mother nature and so many dead .. and. I think a lot about the rest of japan and how it will rebuild itself. how much of a struggle and a leap of faith the Japanese will have to make.<br/><br/>I'm told that in the rest of japan life is carrying on almost normally but rebuilding what has been lost is going to be a massive job.<br/>I hope that the Japanese people we have met over the years are not freaking out, and I like to think the way japan comes out of this will be an inspiration to us all.
