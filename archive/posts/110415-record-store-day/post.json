It is too late to recall the vinyl and stick them on the right way round, so <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://cdn.sandbag.uk.com/RH/TICK002labels.zip\">here is a copy of the labels</a> for those of you who wish to download, print, cut out and stick on yourself with pritt stick (other glues are available) thus correcting the error. Or we could just rename the songs.<br><br>Apologies for any confusion caused and have a happy <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.recordstoreday.co.uk\">Record Store Day</a>.",
