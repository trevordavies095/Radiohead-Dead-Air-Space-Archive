might i suggest that those selling their koko tickets on e bay for stupid money gives a contribution... <br/>say 30 percent of their proceeds, <br/>back to friends of the earth, for whose benefit we are all doing this show.<br/>seems only fair, unless you're a shallow____, dont you think?<br/><br/>by the way listening back to things we are doing and looking through the lyrics today<br/>and stuff it feels like we are finally getting somewhere.  there are lots of songs. too many<br/>to get together straight away. so we will be furiously rehearsing and writing as we go.<br/><br/>... i think we ve always worked best when we arent bothered <br/>about making mistakes. <br/>theres a lot of baggage about the old way of doing things that is hard to get over... <br/>all the  'album' crap..just this level of pressure that is ridiculous..<br/>we're just going to do what feels right at the time <br/>quite intothe idea of singles at the moment(that dont get on the radio)<br/>.. <br/>no grand design... wherever we are at. some of the random stuff we have at the moment<br/>could be the most exciting... trying to figure out how on earth we will be able to play some of it.<br/>anyway it is not important. there is more to life than freaking out about petty bullshit like this. there are<br/>more important things to think about.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
