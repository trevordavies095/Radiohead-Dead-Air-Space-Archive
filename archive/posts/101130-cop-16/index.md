The the COP16 climate summit is now underway in Cancun. <br/>Thanks to those 1500 or so women, men and children who withstood the cold to take part in the Brighton/Hove 350.org earth art exhibit on Saturday.<br/>Some pictures of you can be found <a href="http://earth.350.org/faces-of-king-canute/">here</a>.<br/><br/>Also please note that our current prime minister who once made such positive noises to us and to me personally about his party's commitment to tackling climate change <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/29/cameron-cancun-climate-change-summit">will not be attending</a>.<br/>
