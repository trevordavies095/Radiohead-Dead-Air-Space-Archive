<a class="bol" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/arts/music/06mitchell.html" target="_blank">Willie Mitchell</a><br/><br/><br/>He made some of the sweetest, slinkiest, soulful records ever.  I remember years ago round at Jonny's listening to <br/>" That Driving Beat ", then devouring all the southern soul records he made.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
