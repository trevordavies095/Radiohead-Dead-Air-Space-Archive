so the UN are meeting in Montreal to decide what to do after the Kyoto protocol.<br/><br/>and already the US administration has buried its witless head in the fucking sand.<br/><br/>refusing to take part.<br/><br/>you can even see the strings being pulled.<br/><br/>this is a true evil.<br/><br/>and on tv they are talking about the sahara and how global warming will destroy the lives of the millions who live there soon.<br/><br/>oh and the weather man says how weve got caught out by the extreme snowfall. highly unusual. <br/>cue footage of stranded motorists.<br/>but hey itll be nice for kids. <br/>cue taboganning footage.<br/><br/>and business leaders are meeting tony blair tommorrow to express their concern about gas supplies.<br/>fuck business leaders what about the rest of us?<br/><br/>if ever property in the country had solar panels or mini wind turbines, just like it has water supply and a satelltie dish perhaps we wouldnt need new nuclear power stations that we cant afford to please these fucking business leaders.<br/><br/>thm<br/><br/>p.s. please excuse the swearing. im mad.<br/><br/><br/>
