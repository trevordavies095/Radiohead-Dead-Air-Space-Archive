Hi, and here's the first record for the summer!  I was chuffed when Kathryn asked me to play on it, it's a lovely thing, and heralds bright days and warm nights.  Kieran ' Fourtet'  Hebden is at the controls, and Giles Petersen has picked ' She Was Out in the Water ' to play on BBC Radio 6.<br/><br/>It comes out next week, Monday May 7th.  <br/><br/>You can pre - order it on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/preorder/into-the-trees/id523694309">Itunes</a><br/><br/>You can get the cd from <a href="http://boomkat.com/cds/519132-one-little-plane-into-the-trees">Boomkat</a><br/><br/>There are two tracks streaming on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/one-little-plane">Soundcloud</a>, and the whole record's going up to Soundcloud next week.<br/>
