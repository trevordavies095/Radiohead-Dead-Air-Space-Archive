it is the end of our two week session.<br/><br/>we re splitting up its all shit. were washed. up. finished.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>only kidding.<br/><br/>it was fun. some of it has been really great fun.  and there were moments that stick in my head when i went 'TUNE!'  'TuNE!'<br/><br/><br/>like tonight listening through<br/> ' house of cards.' <br/><br/>its us, no denying it. bu t thats cool.. i like it. it has its own power. cant fight that i suppose. although i see it as my duty to try.<br/><br/>i will dread listening to it all after we have left in the real world. i always dread that. id much rather start something new and  forget. but right now...is good.<br/>guess thats why the blackboard is full.<br/><br/><br/>thm<br/>
