It's very limited free entry, first come first served. Also, as it might be a little uncomfortable for anyone queuing early, they're planning a numbering system so people at the front of any queue can get snacks and toilet breaks in the store. Good bagels round there. But dress <a class='bol' target='_blank' href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/24hr.shtml?world=4581\">warm</a>...doors won't open until 7, and we'll play at about 8.<br><br>For those who can't get in - and it's pretty small in there - we'll have some screens and speakers outside, if we're allowed. I think we are. And we'll also webcast it. I'll put the link up here, as well as any other info, later today. <br><br>Hope you can make it - should be....interesting. Us being us, we're taking far too many instruments.....<br><br><br><br>",
