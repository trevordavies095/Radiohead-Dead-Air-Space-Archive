So, we've got a small gig tonight.<br/><br/>It's in London at the <a class="bol" href="http://www.roughtrade.com/site/content.lasso?page=east.html" target="_blank">Rough Trade East</a> shop on Brick Lane, and we're planning to play a short set of in rainbows material. It's very limited free entry, first come first served. Also, as it might be a little uncomfortable for anyone queuing early, they're planning a numbering system so people at the front of any queue can get snacks and toilet breaks in the store. Good bagels round there. But dress <a class="bol" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/24hr.shtml?world=4581" target="_blank">warm</a>...doors won't open until 7, and we'll play at about 8.<br/><br/>For those who can't get in - and it's pretty small in there - we'll have some screens and speakers outside, if we're allowed. I think we are. And we'll also webcast it. I'll put the link up here, as well as any other info, later today. <br/><br/>Hope you can make it - should be....interesting. Us being us, we're taking far too many instruments.....<br/><br/><br/><br/>
