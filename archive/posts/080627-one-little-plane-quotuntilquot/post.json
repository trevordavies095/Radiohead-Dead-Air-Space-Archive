  "body": "This is a lovely summer's record, one for sunny week end mornings and all the times in between.  It was made by Kathryn, and produced by Kieran Hebden, who has toured with us before as \" Fourtet \".  I left my copy in Oxford, bugger, but I'm getting another one in Manchester.  You can get it from the 30th of June, from Amazon and Boomkat and other fine music outlets.<br>Here is the link to Kathryn's site, with all the touring info.<br><br><a href=http://www.myspace.com/onelittleplane>OneLittlePlane</a>",
