  "body": "Hello<br><p>\nJust wanted to let you know about a benefit show in my hometown, Oxford, that I'm involved with. Its called Childish Things, and takes place on Monday 24th and Tuesday 25th March at The New Theatre. It is a mixture of music and comedy and raises much needed funds for Helen and Douglas House, a hospice in Oxford for children and young adults. Over the past decade, I've had many brilliant nights at Childish Things, both as a performer and part of the audience. This year will be particularly special, as it's the tenth anniversary of the event, and also the last set of shows. Here's some more information about this year's line up, buying tickets and Helen and Douglas House itself:\n<a href=\"http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/childish-things/\" target=\"_blank\"><br></a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/childish-things/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.helenanddouglas.org.uk/childish-things/</a> <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9882WbmfB4M\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9882WbmfB4M</a> <br>\nThank you",
