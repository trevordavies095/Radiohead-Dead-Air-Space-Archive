<i>"Radio is everywhere in the country, and it's a great way to talk to a lot of people from all different situations.It was really great to do an interview. When you get to interview someone, you're learning from them. And you're also sharing with it many people on the radio, so we're all learning."</i> -  Ceswa Mpandamabula, 15, Lusaka<br/><br/>The Children's Radio Foundation is a UNICEF backed project across Africa that I've recently become involved in. It's very interesting and inspiring to me, because it incorporates some of my passions; new  and old media, radio and the internet, and how these technologies can be used to give a continent of young people a voice.   There's more info <a class="bol" href="http://childrensradiofoundation.org/" target="_blank">on their site</a>, and <a class="bol" href="http://soundcloud.com/childrensradiofoundation/childrens-radio-foundation-the" target="_blank">their soundcloud too</a>.
