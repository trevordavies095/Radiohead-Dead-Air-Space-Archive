this is for uk peeps only im afraid.<br/><br/>the british government is drawing up a climate change law.. <br/>committing us to reducing our co2 emmissions.<br/>this is something i am helping friends of the earth uk campaign for.<br/>(as well as working long hours with radiohead on these songs we've got which you may know about.)<br/><br/>if you got involved as well then thank you.. on behalf of us all...<br/>(it is amazing what letters still can do.)<br/>anyway<br/>as is always the way..the bill at the moment is not quite what it should be, to say the least<br/>as they seem to have forgotten about planes and ships..amongst other things.<br/>there is a lot of column inches and internet space and conversation taking place about all this as you know on the subject of climate change.<br/>and it all runs the risk of reaching saturation point. except that it is potentially the most terrifying problem the human world has ever had to face.. <br/>doing our bit.. flying less, etc etc (all those column inches) will not really have any effect unless the uk as a whole decides without excuses and backtracking that we want to really do something.. <br/>unless all of us accepts a law that we all must adhere to... <br/>that has the desired effect rather than creating an illusion..<br/><br/>so if you can be arsed you can take part in saying what you think the bill should contain<br/>this is a public consultation, as the government calls it<br/>(except when it's about nuclear power..)<br/><br/>there is a page on the FOe website at the moment where you can do this<br/><a class="bol" href="http://www.foe.co.uk/campaigns/climate/press_for_change/climate_bill/index.html" target="_blank">HERE!</a><br/><br/><br/>radiohead starts up again having finally caught up on some sleep next week<br/>i have a cd of what we;'ve been up to...<br/>and you haven't.<br/>yet.<br/>(sorry)<br/><br/>i must listen to it, after taking an ear break<br/>that always makes me nervous<br/>hope you're well<br/><br/>yours<br/>
