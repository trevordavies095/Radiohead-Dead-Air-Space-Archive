Radiohead's TV performance of The King Of Limbs is <a href="http://www.thekingoflimbs.com">now available to buy</a> on DVD and BluRay.<br/><br/>In case you didn't see it, the programme is a live studio performance of The King of Limbs. There are also performances of The Daily Mail and Staircase, which haven't been released yet. Supercollider has been added as a bonus track. Thanks to Steve Keros who took some nice pictures to go in the book.<br/><br/>Orders <a href="http://www.thekingoflimbs.com">are being taken now</a> for the DVD &amp; BluRay for Christmas Delivery. If a digital version is all you require, it will be on iTunes from the 19th December. The DVD &amp; BluRay will be in the shops, but probably not until the end of January.<br/><br/></div><div style="clear: both;"></div><div style="width: 560px; margin: auto;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/D2084nQbmvk?rel=0" width="560"></iframe></div>
